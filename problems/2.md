# Add Two Numbers || Medium

## Problem:

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Example 1:
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Example 3: 
```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

For this problem I decided to first convert the lists to their un-reversed integers they represent so the addition can be performed easily.
To do this i pushed each value of the list into an array and then reversed the array, when creating the integer from the array I needed to cast
it to BigInt type as the constraints specify a list can be up to 100 nodes long. Once the integer is created for both lists I add them together
and split them back into an array, then I loop through the arrays components creating a new linked list in reverse order.

```js
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    var number1 = [];
    var number2 = [];
    var holdingList = l1;

    //Looping through the list and pushing the values into an array
    while (holdingList != null) {
        number1.push(holdingList.val);
        holdingList = holdingList.next;
    }
    holdingList = l2;
    while (holdingList != null) {
        number2.push(holdingList.val);
        holdingList = holdingList.next;
    }
    //Reversing the array and converting to a bigInt
    number1 = BigInt(number1.reverse().join(''));
    number2 = BigInt(number2.reverse().join(''));

    //Adding the two numbers and converting to array
    var sum = `${BigInt(number1 + number2)}`.split('');
    
    //Reversing the array and converting to a list
    l3 = new ListNode(sum[0]);
    for(var i = 1; i < sum.length; i++) {
        l3 = new ListNode(sum[i], l3);
    }
    return l3;

};
